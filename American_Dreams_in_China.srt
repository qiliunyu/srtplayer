1
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:11,530
Do you have any plans in the United States after your studies?

2
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,912
No,I will come back to my country

3
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,248
Who are your idols?


4
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:27,373
Who,someone you admire?


5
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,698
Meng Xiaojun

6
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:34,747
Meng zi?

7
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,913
Meng-Xiao-Jun

8
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,832
Mr Meng Xiaojun,congratulations!

9
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,823
Come back at friday to pick up your visa

10
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,410
Thank you

11
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:50,955
Sorry,  I give up my application

12
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:52,864
Why?

13
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,448
I love my country!

14
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,323
He never knows

15
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:05,531
After 20 years,  I am good at helping people go to America.

16
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:16,285
In the general view

17
00:02:16,417 --> 00:02:19,033
Here is the place for teaching chinese people english

18
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,533
This is a cool place for them

19
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:27,865
Here are the scores from TOEFL、GRE and IELTS from the NEW DREAM students

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,537
Americans ask me: how can the scores being so high?

21
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:32,532
You must cheating

22
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:35,033
Americans sometimes is so naive


23
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:41,290
10000 studens who are studying in U.S 

24
00:02:41,417 --> 00:02:43,453
3/4 from NEW DREAM!

25
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,408
Our flag has already inserted through the entire United States

26
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,282
Here is another one.

27
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,240
Wisconsin


28
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,038
Wang yang says

29
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:02,000
For hundred years, Chinese people don't know how to speak english use their mouth.

30
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,535
why don't you just open your mouth?

31
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,249
because your confidence has destroyed by the traditional education

32
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,866
Scared your broken-english make other people feel bad.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,582
But don't forget,your english sucks

34
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,371
That will only make other people suffering,what are your afraid of?

35
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,408
Meng Xiaojun,he doesn't like talk in public

36
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:20,032
He likes private chat

37
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,532
That's because you're not confident enough


38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,786
You think he is talking to you about visa


39
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,999
In fact, he is talking about America


40
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,992
Self confidence is the most basic requirements for individual in America culture


41
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,911
I have no confidence


42
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,660
I am afraid of being rejected


43
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,454
Courage is resistance to fear


44
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:37,244
Mastery of fear

45
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,240
Not absence of fear

46
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:42,372
Mr Meng

47
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,953
I've fell in love with you over a year

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,615
I’m married


49
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:54,581
I know,but at least you can see my courage now

50
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,947
Meng Xiaojun's grandfather
is a doctor that returned after studied in U.S in 1925

51
00:03:59,542 --> 00:04:01,453
gave him a English dictionary


52
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,249
His Father is a doctor that returned after studied in U.S in 1955

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,740
gave him another English dictionary

54
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,499
Meng xiaojun's family history is America

55
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,573
His destiny

56
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,866
Just like he and Liang Qin's love

57
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,993
I think a man's dream

58
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,990
aways begins from a woman

59
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,036
Before I know my frist love

60
00:04:47,167 --> 00:04:49,249
I always help another girl to carry hot water

61
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,911
Then I found out she got a boy friend

62
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:52,202
I asked her

63
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,073
Why you still let me to carry hot water for you?

64
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:56,574
She said:That's because she wanted her boy friend to take a break

65
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,703
Although she kept refuse me over and over again

66
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,249
But I still wanted to see her everyday

67
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,703
Because she was my dream

68
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,618
What is dream?

69
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:11,949
Dream is a kind thing that makes u want to hold on

70
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,789
and feel happy

71
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,993
20 years ago,  I was the one usually give the speech

72
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:28,287
Niu Yongxiao who came from the NEW DREAM says

73
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,291
You are the one of the most unprincipled person
he've seen in his entire life

74
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,032
Do you agree with him?

75
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,078
He should remove the "one of"

76
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:38,530
20 years ago,Cheng Dongqing has not yet learned how to talk about jokes in public

77
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,158
Meng Xiaojun also doesn't acting so serious

78
00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:43,157
Only I got no change

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,411
Meng Xiaojun says he loved America

80
00:05:48,542 --> 00:05:50,749
He does say:loved

81
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,290
But me,the godfather of the students
Never been to America

82
00:05:57,292 --> 00:06:00,705
And today,America sues us

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,365


84
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,452


85
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,493


86
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:14,618


87
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,947


88
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:21,746


89
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,740


90
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,869


91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,582


92
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:39,572


93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,539


94
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,203


95
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,539


96
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:51,783
Cheng Dongqing was a loser in 1979

97
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,954
2 times failed the college entrance examination

98
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,660
I want to take another exam

99
00:06:56,792 --> 00:06:58,453
Family can't afford anymore

100
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,572
If you want to another exam

101
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:02,575
Mom has to borrow money,get up

102
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:03,663
Uncle Get up

103

104
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:07,447
Get up get up…

105
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,368
How about

106
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,582
Let Dongqing take another exam

107
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:13,324
Yeah  Rice still grow in the fields

108
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,824
Well, this will be the last time

109
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:19,118
That's it

110
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,457
Let's go

111
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,823
Please wait

112
00:07:24,292 --> 00:07:25,281
Money

Money

114
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,365
Americans never know

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,161
Chinese hero can get down on his kneel

116
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:34,329
Even can crawl through other people's crotch

117
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:10,534
Shen Qing, I love you

118
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:11,873
56

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,331
57

120
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,073
58

121
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:29,409
My frist day in college
I met Wang Yang and Meng Xiaojun

122
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,573


123
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,824


124
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,081


125
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,574


126
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:41,120


127
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:41,955


128
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,744
Are you insane

129
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,581
I'm reading  what are you yelling of?

130
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:46,868
Go taking your own shit

131
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,580


132
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,572


133
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:53,197
Jerk

134
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,163
Damn you

135
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,536
Stop,  People get hit!

136
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:05,952
Wait there,don't run!

137
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:12,373
Sorry dude

138
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,990
You should blame that neuropathy didn't mind his own shit

139
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:14,784
Who are you talking about?

140
00:09:14,917 --> 00:09:16,327
You! what you just called me?

141
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:17,538
Are you alright?

142
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:18,873

143
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,910

00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:32,783
Cheng Dongqing,where's the place you most want to go

147
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:33,867
Tian An Men square

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,785
Tian An Men square

149
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:35,702
Why?

150
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,948
Cheng Dongqing,let me tell you

151
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:38,698

152
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,369
Meng Xiaojun told me

153
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,661
The place everyone wants to go is 

154
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:43,952
America

155
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,369
That's it,we finish reading today

156
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,744
Oh,there one last request

157
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:55,534
I wann you guys try to use a word to describe our generation

158
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:56,497
Catching up

159
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,785
The ideal

160
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:58,372
Impulse


161
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,080
Freedom

162
00:09:59,208 --> 00:09:59,617
Doubt

163
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,660
The pretty

164
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,497
Lonely

165
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,448
Desire sincere

166
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,323
What about you, Cheng Dongqing?

167
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,247
Red flag never fall

168
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,914
Have you ever thought,right here

169
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:16,450
We've been talking too much thoughts、doctrines、methods

170
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:18,497
Why?

171
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:21,624
Because we all want to find a ready answer

172
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,456
We all hope someone can tell us

173
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:25,039
How to live our lifes

174
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:26,747
In fact

175
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:29,161
No one can tell us how to live our lifes

176
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,372
Lifes belong to our own

177
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,325
We should find the answers for our own questions by ourselves 

178
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,447
So I think

179
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,203
The most important thing in our generation is

180
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:38,163
Change

181
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,202
Change everyone around us

182
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,448
Change everything around us

183
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,290
And the only one thing won't change that's our courage

184
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,365
If we can do that

185
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,785
We will change the world!

186
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:49,499


187
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,240


188
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,660
Meng Xiaojun told me

189
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,374
Only one place can really change the world

190
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,198
U.S.A

191
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,244
So what do you think of U.S.A?

192
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,786
Wang Yang is always busy join dancing parties

193
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:04,161
Sometimes also accepts interview

194
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,286
Although it's violate the school's rules

195
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,282
USA  In Chinese is "Mei Guo"

196
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,658
Means beautiful country

197
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,199
In Japan,it means

198
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,493
"Mi Guo"

199
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:15,997
It sounds like

200
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,035
"Rice country"

201
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,247
Rice country?

202
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,410
That's right

203
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,954
Later,Wang Yang asks Lucy to interview him very often

204
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,916


205
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,373


206
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,333


207
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,074


208
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,742


209
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:41,663


210
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:43,702


211
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,540


212
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:51,531


213
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,249



214
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,536


215
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:01,577


216
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:03,572


217
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:04,413


218
00:12:04,542 --> 00:12:05,076


219
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,163


220
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,788


221
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,157


222
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,205


223
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,573


224
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:12,989


225
00:12:15,292 --> 00:12:15,951


226
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,368


227
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:19,242


228
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:20,285


229
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:22,452
Cheng Dongqing

230
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,119
Have you been learned the japanese

231
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,581
Oh yeah,that one you have is legacy version

232
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,699
You should read the oxford version

233
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,322
Look,  "Louse"means lice

234
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,456
lice from the animals

235
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,706
Can I?

236
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,740
Sorry

237
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,199
It doesn't matter

238
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:52,407
I promise to Meng Xiaojun

239
00:12:53,167 --> 00:12:54,282
In order to be like him

240
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,369
I will read 800 books during all my 4 years in college

241
00:12:58,167 --> 00:13:00,408
I will sweep the whole Yanjing University library

242
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:03,123
I only have to ask Wang Yang for help

243
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,912
Let him to get a key from library manager

244
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,456
I thought I was the frist one
sneaked into the school library instead of stealing books

245
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:35,748
Stop following me

246
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,822
There is a kind girl will refuse you

247
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,203
Before you talk

248
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:52,621
Wang Yang says the love is like a video camera

249
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:56,575
Sometimes needs to fast forward,and sometimes needs to rewind

250
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,249
Sometimes,needs to pause

251
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,036
Sorry

252
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:19,075
Now Lucy press the fast forward button

253
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,371


254
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:46,618


255
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:51,291


256
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,365


257
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,283


258
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,873
He vomited

259
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,534
Vomited...

260
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,203
also cried all night

261
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,039
I only cry for one thing

262
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:42,036
When I myself boared on the TIME magazine in America

263
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,328
Why don't you say when you become American president

264
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,244
Actually that's the only thing i can't do

265
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,365
You have to born in U.S

266
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:52,621
U.S will never get rid of racial discrimnation

267
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:53,747
If a white person

268
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:57,447
see 3 black men entered the elevator at same time

269
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,245
He will escape the elevator 

270
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:01,581
right before the door close

271
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:03,618
In the opinion of white people

272
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:08,119
Black people are always the lazy、ignorant and savage race

273
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,869
So those chinese Americans should be clever and hardworking in America

274
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,989
But they say

275
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,743
Chinese people destroyed local people's job opportunities.

276
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,456
Sir

277
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,493
Have you been in America before?

278
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,073
All you know about America is from the book

279
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,910
Yes sir

280
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:27,873
Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth

281
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,206
What's the major of you two people?

282
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,994
The"American dream"

283
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,449
is the dream that everybody has the equal opportunities

284
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:35,572
Only U.S.A can do that in the world

285
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:38,620
Young man,you are too young

286
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,580
Too naive

287
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,030
Sir,I will go to America

288
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,248
I'll find out by myself

289
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:51,827
Sit down!

290
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,822
You need finish the class

291
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:53,868
Who the hell is you

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,864
He is my teacher

293
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,989
Non of your business

294
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,832
Teacher deserves respect!

295
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,285
What the hell is this world

296
00:19:04,417 --> 00:19:04,872
Beat them up

297
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,080
Run!

298
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,780
If I didn't qualify 
to become their good friend

299
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,412
Now I do

300
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,116
Meng Xiaojun says if I keep chasing Su Mei just like kicking against the pricks

301
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:43,038
Wang Yang says he gonna help me do the "kick" thing

302
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,498
She is coming

303
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,074
I gonna move away the ladder

304
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,748
Hold on

305
00:19:51,042 --> 00:19:51,952
Good luck

306
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:05,452
Ladder

307
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,743
What the...

308
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,081
Ladder

309
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,789
Rorbert Frost says

310
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:17,580
A mother used 20 years to make her son cleer

311
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:20,283
while a girl make him a stupid 

312
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,078
in 20 seconds

313
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,328
Hey,time's up

314
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,407
If you don't accept me

315
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,990
I will drag you jump with me

316
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:44,373
Would die rather than surrender

317
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,243
Jump

318
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,865
I can't swim

319
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,663
Jump!

320
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,824
At last, Su Mei got acute pneumonia

321
00:20:55,292 --> 00:20:58,705
Wang Yang says this "kick" just like a protracted war


322
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,745
The most important tactics is clingy consumption of the other side

323
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,708
At last you may get her

324
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,743
Beat it

325
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:13,411
I told you,beat it

326
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:20,202
Just leave

327
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,868
it's infective

328
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:50,864
Cheng Dongqing

329
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,615
Why you

330
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:58,248
Why you?

331
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,081
Why it can't be me?

332
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,990
Be accompanied by the cough sound

333
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:11,910
At last

334
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:15,580
I got tuberculosis,had to take a year off

335
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,620


336
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,286


337
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:28,831


338
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:33,036
One day when i was in hospital

339
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,952
Wang Yang asked Meng Xiaojun

340
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,990
to come to hospital visit me 

341
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:38,572
May i leave now

342
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,330


343
00:22:41,458 --> 00:22:42,163
Bye

344
00:22:43,875 --> 00:22:46,161
I didn't see any thing,"Dai Yu"

345
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,243
I really can't go there

346
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,410
TOEFL exam is coming soon

347
00:22:52,292 --> 00:22:53,873

350
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,994
Give this to him

351
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,697
I fulfilled my promise  finished 800 books

My english no longer be heard as japanese

353

Lucy says she doesn't wann to leave China

360
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,581
Wang Yang gave up the visa for her

361
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:51,157
Why?

362
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,825
Why reject me?

363
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:58,075

"Hope one day I will make you jealous"

369
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:29,618
Meng Xiaojun says he was born for this day 

370
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,787
His grandfather and father all been studied in U.S.A

00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,870
Xiao Jun,I've been busy having class recently

401
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,789
The students like my class

402
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:33,622
Because other classes make them tired,they can go sleep in my class

403
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:35,497
Also

404
00:27:36,875 --> 00:27:38,411
I love my country

405
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:42,322

Mr Cheng,here is the mail from U.S

412
00:28:01,708 --> 00:28:04,620
Xiao Jun,don't you send TIME magazine

413
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,036
Because you haven't on the cover yet

414
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,281
Right?

415
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:13,534
I think this magazine is more suitable for Wang Yang

416
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:18,619
But I still need to check it frist with critical eyes

417
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,330
Got water?

418
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:27,992

The latest date of TOEFL ridiculously expensive

420
00:28:37,333 --> 00:28:38,322
Wait a little longer

Be careful

424
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,783

488
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:25,033


489
00:33:26,083 --> 00:33:30,076


490
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,746


491
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:39,791

495
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:59,331


496
00:33:59,458 --> 00:34:03,155

Cheng Dongqing,I told the visa officer

500
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,661
When I finish my study...

501
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,574
Lucy broke up with Wang Yang

502
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:49,656
Lucy said her VCR now only has the fast forward function

503
00:34:49,792 --> 00:34:51,077
She wants to go back to America

504
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,990
Because the luggage has been more than enough

505
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,911
Will be overweighted if take Wang Yang with her

506
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:59,992
No one is willing to publish my book

507
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:04,159
Now you are just a pile of waste paper

508
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,865
I'm just a neuropathy

509
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:10,991


510
00:35:11,167 --> 00:35:14,534


511
00:35:20,917 --> 00:35:24,159


512
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:28,035


513
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:38,531
Wang Yang said  His 80s die today

514
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,698
Very cheap

515

Why you moved here?

521
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,915

524
00:36:43,667 --> 00:36:45,578
Oh right,Old Di went into business in Hainan

525
00:36:45,708 --> 00:36:47,414
He mailed 2 boxes of coconut milk coffee to you

526
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:48,827
But it doesn't taste good,so I won't send no more

527
00:36:48,958 --> 00:36:52,030
Cheng Dongqing kept come here to call Su Mei every week

528
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,864
Su Mei said she studies very hard everyday for the scholarship

529
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,865
Except that she goes to a restaurant wash dishes

530
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,786
Hurry up, we're off duty

531
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:05,624
Every time when i called,at last Su Mei would say

532
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,116
That's it, I'm tired

533
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:17,907
Cheng Dongqing

534
00:37:18,042 --> 00:37:21,364
Professor Oilver treated me very nice,and the students also very friendly

535
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:23,202


536
00:37:23,625 --> 00:37:25,490


537
00:37:26,375 --> 00:37:28,741


538
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:30,411


539
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,911
The assistant needs high professional requirements 

540
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,784
Although it's hard but compare with washing dishes

541
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,327
here is the heaven

542
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,081
Xiao Jun

543
00:37:39,208 --> 00:37:40,243


544
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,038


545
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:48,575


546
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:50,824


547
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:55,030


548
00:37:55,625 --> 00:37:57,957


549
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,789


550
00:37:59,917 --> 00:38:03,455


551
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:06,123


552
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,450
Cheng Dongqing  I with Liang Qin rented apartment

553
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:34,367
Near the school,only 2 blocks away

554
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:38,659
Although it's a little noisy but we got good lighting

555
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,578
If I keep teaching piano like this

556
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,662
I'm gonna lose my hands someday

557
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:52,367
But it's ok,  You still got a laboratory job

558
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,411
So we can move away from here soon

559
00:38:57,458 --> 00:38:58,823
We are still lucky

560
00:38:59,583 --> 00:39:01,244
At least we're still doing our old profession

561
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:04,617
In the letter you wrote me doesn't say so

562
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,039
I got caught by school being tutor outside

563
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:16,623
They may fire me

564
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,081
Congratulations

565
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,786
You will long live in your students hearts

566
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,493
I'm in college now

567
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:28,122
My mom owns every neighbors money in the village,don't want her to repay

568
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:34,367
If I were you,I would resign before they fire me

569
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:38,245
Resign? It would take me starve to death

570
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,161
I already quit,Am I dead here?

571
00:39:40,292 --> 00:39:42,283
If not me,you should've dead already

572
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:45,323
The world has changed

573
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,289
Selling eggs in the street even earn more than you did

574
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:49,328
Don't worry, you will be alright

575
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,535
Keep watching

576
00:39:51,208 --> 00:39:54,075
I break the rules from school and run private english training class

577
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:57,496
deserve punishment

578
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,581
With a heartfelt admiration

579
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,912
But earnestly request the leadership give me a chance

580
00:40:03,417 --> 00:40:06,830
to take the lighter punishment

581
00:40:07,208 --> 00:40:10,120
Self-criticism person: Cheng Dongqing

582
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:27,537


583
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:33,828


584
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,620


585
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,368


586
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:50,948
Cheng Dongqing

587
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,907
Let's break up

588
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:12,037
This year,  Beijing's bid failed

589
00:41:13,458 --> 00:41:15,870
Both of them stayed behind

590
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:18,539


591
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,331
Stayed behind

592
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:21,656


593
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:30,155
You can not sleep in class

594
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:33,286
You are at the best university

595
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:36,250
You parents spent all their money sent you here

596
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:38,240
Not for sleeping 

597
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:40,206
If you don't like my class

598
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,448
You can leave

599
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,448
Why you want to learn english

600
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,494
Go to America, Mr Cheng

601
00:42:04,083 --> 00:42:05,243
Do you like English?

602
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,535
No

603
00:42:06,667 --> 00:42:07,827
So am I

604
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:08,743
Really

605
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:11,619
But you know my vocabularies is also good

606
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:13,823
That's because of you

607
00:42:13,958 --> 00:42:16,370
One day a student bring up a english word
and ask me

608
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,785
How to read this word

609
00:42:20,667 --> 00:42:22,498
It knows me but i don't know it

610
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:27,740
I feel so embarrassed

611
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,660
So I went back to read dictionaries

612
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:31,248
One by one

613
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,914
See any of you can got me

614
00:42:36,417 --> 00:42:37,623
You know

615
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,331
The most thing I afraid of is other people look down on me

616
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:40,948
Because I'm from country side

617
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,865
So I always want to please them

618
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,742
My best friends Meng Xiaojun and Wang Yang laughed at me

619
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:48,491
Said:Don't act like you are stupid

620
00:42:48,917 --> 00:42:49,872
stupid

621
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,914
I wasn't sure what they were talking about

622
00:42:53,042 --> 00:42:54,202
and even refuted them

623
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:55,782
I'm not acting like stupid

624
00:42:56,208 --> 00:42:57,493
I am stupid

625
00:43:00,583 --> 00:43:04,701
And later I got a girl, the most beautiful girl in school to be my girl friend

626
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:07,206
Then we graduated

627
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,746
After graduation, we studied TOEFL,and went to get visa

628
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,038
In the end, she passed,I was rejected

629
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:18,414
So I become...

630
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:21,499
The man who was left behind

631
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:23,623


632
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:26,706
She slept with me right before she left China

633
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:43,286
Mr Cheng,Why you acting so different today

634
00:43:49,917 --> 00:43:51,157
Students

635
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:03,414
Cheng Dongqing, who from the forgein language department 
Because run private classes outside the school

636
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:08,912
Has disrupted the order of teaching rules in school
Caused serious adverse effects

637
00:44:09,042 --> 00:44:11,078
So the school decide

638
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:15,744
Give the teacher Cheng Dongqing dismissed faculty punishment

639
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:20,997


640
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,706


641
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:26,120
Cheng Dongqing became the frist teacher
dismissed faculty publicly

642
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,615
He was written into school's history

643
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:30,203
This is the thing even Meng Xiaojun can't be done

644
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:33,287
That day he was forced out of the teacher's dormitory

645
00:44:33,417 --> 00:44:34,076
Mr Cheng

646
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,072
Mr Cheng

647
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:36,914
Where is your private school?

648
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,911
I will take the TOEFL exam next month

649
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:43,079
I'm afraid of examination,and I would like to join your english tutor class

650
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:47,948
No one knows better than me

651
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:49,705
He had no choice

652
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,332
If he didn't accept,He had to go back to his hometown

653
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,956
And speak english to rice in the field everyday

654
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,698
You should understand

655
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,164
Su Mei won't leave America

656
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:04,657
So she had to break up with you

657
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:06,372
What's wrong

658
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,786
I think my youth is over

659
00:45:09,417 --> 00:45:10,907
And buried here

660
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,748
You are disgusting

661
00:45:17,125 --> 00:45:19,537
When a lovelorn person suffering starvation

662
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:20,952
will acting abnormal

663
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:24,120
Whenever Cheng dongqing found a wall

664
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:26,662
He would start posting ads

665
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:29,829
Almost all the walls near this area
all damaged by us

666
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:33,449
He almost climbed all telegraph poles in Yanjing University

667
00:45:33,917 --> 00:45:35,999
The way I used taught him to chase that girl

668
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,999
Now he is using it to sell his training class

669
00:45:48,917 --> 00:45:50,873
Cheng Dongqing picked here for the training class

670
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,285
Only one reason

671
00:45:52,417 --> 00:45:54,658
Order 1 chicken nugget, you can sit here all day

672
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:56,407


673
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:57,907
Progressive

674
00:45:58,042 --> 00:45:59,373


675
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,455
Lower your voice

676
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:01,948
Progressive

677
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,123
Go get another chicken nugget

678
00:46:10,542 --> 00:46:12,032
Today we talk about this

679
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:13,202


680
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:14,822
Ambulance

681
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:15,947
How to make your remember better?

682
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:18,118
(in chinese:I can't die)

683
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:19,285
Ambulance

684
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:20,202


685
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,118
Pregnant

686
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,456
(in chinese:I want a boy)

687
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:23,656
(in Chinese:A man jump to me)

688
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:24,451
Pregnant

689
00:46:24,583 --> 00:46:25,572


690
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,743
In fact

691
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,786
the choice made by a person who under the living helpless 

692
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,205
Always right

693
00:46:31,083 --> 00:46:32,789
But this is not a permanet fix

694
00:46:33,542 --> 00:46:34,873
We need a more bigger place

695
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,615
more students

696
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,206
How about you join with me to be my partner

697
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:41,283
You're better than me,and you well trained by American chicks

698
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:43,035
We're on same boat

699
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:44,952
All yours

700
00:46:45,333 --> 00:46:49,406
Successful people always spontaneously with the needs of the times

701
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,372
Who said that

702
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,455
Carnegie

703
00:46:54,417 --> 00:46:55,953
I thought you said he is a liar

704
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:58,540
The biggest liar actually is ourselves

705
00:46:59,042 --> 00:47:00,998
Because we always want to change other people

706
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,535
And refuse to change ourselves

707
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,782
I'm in if there more chicken nuggets

708
00:47:07,542 --> 00:47:09,203
This huge place is ours now

709
00:47:10,208 --> 00:47:11,914
This is a abandoned country-owned factory

710
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:13,831
All workers here are laid-off at home now

711
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:16,199
Cheng Dongqing,the chicken thief

712
00:47:16,958 --> 00:47:19,165
After he took advantage of American grandpa

713
00:47:19,292 --> 00:47:22,284
and now he gonna take advantage of this country

714
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,410
Students

715
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:48,500
Learn english just like learn bird chirp

716
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:50,081
When you are learning bird chirp in the woods

717
00:47:50,208 --> 00:47:52,369
If there 4 birds land on your shoulders

718
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,081
That means you just passed english leve-4

719
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,745
If there 6 birds on your shoulders

720
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:58,828
That means you passed english leve-6

721
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,744
When there a flock of birds on your shoulders

722
00:48:00,875 --> 00:48:02,536
That means you past the TOEFL

723
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:04,373
That means you become a bird man!

724
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:09,328
Outside there was a girl came to ask me

725
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12,241
Mr Cheng,I fall in love with one guy

726
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:14,366
But except He has good looking face

727
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:15,489
No other advantage

728
00:48:15,625 --> 00:48:16,535
How should I do

729
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:17,497
I told her

730
00:48:17,625 --> 00:48:20,367
If this girl looking for a guy only for his good looking face

731
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,115
That's called"Hao se"

732
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:23,955
Horny

733
00:48:25,292 --> 00:48:28,159
But if a guy looking for a girl for her good looking face

734
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:29,372
That's called"Shen mei"

735
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,368
Aesthetics

736
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,538
But my aesthetic ability has been maintained 
at the statutory range

737
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:39,079
Later I catched up with the most beautiful girl in legal system

738
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:42,120
This loser mocked his love in his class

739
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,535
For make students laugh

740
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:46,409
He was so mean  Must very painful in his heart

741
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,248


742
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,582


743
00:48:50,708 --> 00:48:52,824


744
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,449
But I'm using the Hollywood movie teaching method

745
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:57,414


746
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:01,405


747
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:03,830
Did you not hear me?

748
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,823
Most of it,Just...

749
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,414
You never seen this moive

750
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:09,248
Malone Brando's "on the waterfront"

751
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,956
Nope

752
00:49:11,083 --> 00:49:12,698
So what moive you watched recently

753
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:13,538
"Ghost"

754
00:49:16,917 --> 00:49:17,952


755
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,036


756
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,281


757
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:26,038
Ditto

758
00:49:26,542 --> 00:49:27,873
"the same ,like before"

759
00:49:28,583 --> 00:49:30,073
Means:" Me too"

760
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:31,823
Using"Ditto"word

761
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:34,995
It gives affectionate

762
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,448


763
00:49:37,583 --> 00:49:39,539


764
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:40,281
Ditto

765
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:40,997


766
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,114


767
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,036


768
00:49:44,417 --> 00:49:45,122
Ditto

769
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:45,955


770
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:50,915
I and Wang Yang all have 12 classes each day

771
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:52,578
From morning to the midnight

772
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,864
Very tired

773
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,407
Wang Yang said he got bad memory when he was tired

774
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:59,370
Never ask why we are doing this 

775
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:01,285
But feel happy

776
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:08,157
We got the money

777
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,368
Bro

778
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:50,410
- Bro  - Stop!

779
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:53,079
What would you do if the life deceive you

780
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:55,864
You're drunk

781
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,116
You should deceive back from your life!

782
00:51:07,792 --> 00:51:13,287


783
00:51:13,875 --> 00:51:19,120


784
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:30,831


785
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:38,120


786
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:44,947


787
00:51:52,833 --> 00:51:54,039
Meng Xiaojun

788
00:51:54,167 --> 00:51:55,657
We can't change the world

789
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:57,910
The world is changing us

790
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,073


791
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:07,993


792
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,116


793
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:11,114


794
00:52:14,208 --> 00:52:15,698


795
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,580


796
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,535


797
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,239


798
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:25,410


799
00:52:32,292 --> 00:52:33,657


800
00:52:33,792 --> 00:52:35,328


801
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,583


802
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:41,910


803
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,578


804
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:48,827


805
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:52,781


806
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,285
I did lied to you

807
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,198
But you lied to me too

808
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,618
You said we came to U.S for doing great things

809
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,410
Meng Xiaojun

810
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,990
We are here for what?

811
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,573
Hometown's rule:

812
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:35,164
After long way back

813
00:54:35,292 --> 00:54:36,873
Cut hair before go inside the house

814
00:54:46,042 --> 00:54:46,952
Wang Yang 

815
00:54:47,625 --> 00:54:49,035
Ask some girls tonight

816
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:50,748
We got a bro back from U.S

817
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:52,327
Not married

818
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,581
Keep the biggest room for us tonight

819
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,539

- Yours - yeah

824
00:55:31,417 --> 00:55:32,953
Here is a little bit far from downtown

825
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,698
So the students have to live here

826
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:36,739
But Xiaojun

827
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:40,245
I think we might got good future 

828
00:55:40,375 --> 00:55:42,866
Of course we can't compare with you in the U.S

829
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:46,989
Comrade,  Please let the chief finish his talk

830

833
00:56:06,917 --> 00:56:07,827

Please allow me to introduce the keynote speaker for today

835
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:11,873
Mr Meng Xiaojun

836
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,662
He has just returned from the U.S

837
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,999
He's my idol 

838
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,456
The one I want to catch up

839
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,078
but only approach his greatness

840
00:56:21,208 --> 00:56:23,665
Please use the applause to welcome Mr Meng

841
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,992
truth、self confidence、specific、reasonable

842
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:45,289
Is the basic idea of the principles of philosophy USA visa

843
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:02,703
If Lack of confidence,He...

844
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:03,906
will be weak

845
00:57:05,583 --> 00:57:06,993
very weak

846
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,205
He...

847
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:11,619
He believes that the weak...

848
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:30,410
Sorry

849
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:37,118
Students

850
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,289
Mr Meng just returned from U.S

851
00:57:41,417 --> 00:57:42,748
Still has jetlag

852
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,991
it's called "Suffering Jetlag"

853
00:57:45,125 --> 00:57:46,285
Suffering Jetlag

854
00:57:46,417 --> 00:57:48,123
Suffering Jetlag

855
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,457
Yes,very good

856
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:03,118


857
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,243
There another speech tommorow

858
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,038
Cancel it

859
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:09,618
Why

860
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,535
He didn't sleep well

861
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:15,118
Doesn't looks like it

862
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:17,581
He is the one too harsh to himself

863
00:58:18,125 --> 00:58:20,457
Maybe that's"Stage Fright"

864
00:58:20,583 --> 00:58:21,493
Impossible

865
00:58:22,125 --> 00:58:23,331
He never had this before

866
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:25,198
You haven't seen him for years

867
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,865
I cleared myself

868
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,365
No body knows America more than me

869
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,991
I won't do any large lecture anymore

870
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,457
I will do the one-on-one interview for visa,mock interview

871
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:37,412
Oh yeah,if who wants go to U.S, they must get through...

872
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:38,622
The NEW DREAM

873
00:58:41,667 --> 00:58:43,328
As for the speech phobia

874
00:58:43,458 --> 00:58:46,120
No one metioned it again

875
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,823
As it never happened

876
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,739
I don't understand

877
00:58:52,292 --> 00:58:54,078
What's the matter with your girl friend related to your visa being jejected

878
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,243
She hurt me

879
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:57,707
She metioned break up with me only in a month after she arrived in U.S

880
00:58:57,833 --> 00:58:58,447
That's good

881
00:58:58,583 --> 00:58:59,789
That means she didn't cheat you

882
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:02,157
She could tell you about this after a year

883
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,581
Let's talk about your visa being rejected

884
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:09,075
It shows the reason you being rejected
because they think you have the tendency of immigrants

885
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,573
I don't want to immigrants

886
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:12,282
Even they give me that chance 

887
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,658
But no matter how I tried to explain they just didn't listen

888
00:59:14,792 --> 00:59:16,623
Well, since you have no tendency of immigrants

889
00:59:17,083 --> 00:59:18,573
Why you wrote this on the application form

890
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:20,573
The purpose you go to U.S 

891
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:21,947
for increase revenue 

892
00:59:22,083 --> 00:59:23,289
I was telling the truth

893
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,499
Everyone knows that in the America you can easily earn more than in China

894
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:26,205
Right

895
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,745
If the applicant has any sign 
shows the purpose he want to go to U.S

896
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,706
Not only for receive the education

897
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,913
It would be denied

898
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:33,077
You haven't even thought of this

899
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:35,449
means you don't know America

900
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:37,824
You blame your girlfriend means you don't know women

901
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,449
Long story short,You don't know yourself

902
00:59:40,583 --> 00:59:42,824
Go back to modify the application form

903
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,364
Mr Meng

904
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:48,993
Thank you very much!

905
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:50,322
Next

906
00:59:50,458 --> 00:59:51,117
Let me tell you 

907
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:54,447
The visa officer wants to see
active and enthusiastic students who eager to talk

908
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,618
You can't even speak clearly

909
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:56,614
Second day

910
00:59:57,375 --> 01:00:01,448
The line of the students who came to join Meng Xiaojun's mock interview
Has been discharged into the street

911
01:00:01,583 --> 01:00:02,743
Do you think Americans are easy to fool?

912
01:00:02,875 --> 01:00:03,580
Can't you talk?

913
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:05,164
If you keep crying,I can't teach you anything 

914
01:00:05,292 --> 01:00:08,079
You should show the momentum as a green card is a piece of toilet paper 

915
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:09,118
Even too hard to wipe your ass

916
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,080
Today

917
01:00:11,083 --> 01:00:13,540
The one who take Meng Xiaojun's interview is Wang Yang

918
01:00:13,958 --> 01:00:15,448
Your moive methods of teaching

919
01:00:15,583 --> 01:00:16,322
has slow effect

920
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:17,492
No structure

921
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,660
Have you ever thought

922
01:00:19,042 --> 01:00:20,077
Why your oral english is better than me?

923
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:20,742
Why?

924
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:24,705
Because you are the only one used to got American chicks

925
01:00:24,833 --> 01:00:26,073
Are you still contact with Lucy?

926
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:27,823
Non of your business

927
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,448
You think you can also guide me?

928
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:31,915
You know what is the core of the English

929
01:00:33,042 --> 01:00:34,407
It's not expression

930
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:36,327
But logical thinking

931
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:38,244
You know what Americans think

932
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,161
So you speak like Americans 

933
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:43,286
Teach this to your students

934
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:45,490
No other people can do this

935
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:47,573
One student came to ask me

936
01:00:47,708 --> 01:00:48,823
I have correct oral english

937
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,038
Correct grammar

938
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:51,077
Huge vocabularies

939
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:52,744
I can easily read the "China Daily"

940
01:00:52,875 --> 01:00:54,331
Better than read the "Beijing Evening News"

941
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,164
If that means I have good English

942
01:00:56,542 --> 01:00:58,453
Then I gave to him a piece of news from "The Wall Street Journal"

943
01:00:58,583 --> 01:01:00,995
Same one reported on "China Daily"

944
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:02,873
He hardly understand this news

945
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,286
He was so surprised and asked me why

946
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:06,368
I told him

947
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,082
"China daily" Just wrote in English

948
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:14,532
But the  "The Wall Street Journal"
wrote by American logical thinking

949
01:01:14,667 --> 01:01:17,864
So,if you really want to learn good English,you must remember

950
01:01:18,417 --> 01:01:20,578
American English thinking

951
01:01:20,708 --> 01:01:21,447
Good speech

952
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:23,915
But you should give a more vivid example

953
01:01:25,125 --> 01:01:25,784
For example

954
01:01:25,917 --> 01:01:27,623
An American go to your home

955
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,035
He knocked,you open the door

956
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:30,031
What's the frist words you would say

957
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:30,747
Welcome!

958
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,411
Americans don't say welcome to their friends

959
01:01:32,542 --> 01:01:34,453
They are drect and not so polite 

960
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:35,493
So he would say

961
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:38,116
Come in,  Then you just go in

962
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,365
More

963
01:01:40,542 --> 01:01:41,702
vivid?

964
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:47,075
You with a foreign girl had 4 years relationship

965
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:49,248
And one day she came to you and say

966
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,707
I'm going back to America alone

967
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,456
How you suppose to answer this one

968
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:57,540
Don't you love me anymore?

969
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,282
Don't go,stay with me

970
01:01:59,417 --> 01:02:00,031
No

971
01:02:01,042 --> 01:02:02,327
Don't say anything

972
01:02:02,458 --> 01:02:03,538
Turn around and leave

973
01:02:04,542 --> 01:02:06,828
Otherwise she will treat you like a piece of luggage

974
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,035
Perfect!

975
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:12,661
Last person who took Meng Xiaojun's interview

976
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:13,998
Is me

977
01:02:14,917 --> 01:02:15,997
Do you have a dream

978
01:02:17,083 --> 01:02:19,244
You don't have to make the atmosphere so ecstasy

979
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:21,573
Be serious, ok?

980
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:24,616
As for me, I'm responsible for the visa consulting

981
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:27,829
Wang Yang teaches the American English thinking

982
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:30,074
Actually this is technological competitiveness

983
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:32,665
What do you think is the core competitiveness of the NEW DREAM?

984
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:34,781
It's you

985
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:36,114
This is not funny

986
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,114
I'm very sincerely

987
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:38,535
Alright,I say

988
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:41,658
I'm not sure whether you have a dream or not

989
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,077
But you should understand

990
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:47,121
No one can be more persuasive

991
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:48,622
than this incompetent president 

992
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:50,538
Cheng Dongqing

993
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,163
You are our core competitiveness

994
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:56,948
Just read what've wrote

995
01:02:57,083 --> 01:02:59,165
Subject: What is the dream

996
01:02:59,292 --> 01:03:00,156
Your turn

997
01:03:11,333 --> 01:03:12,288
Students

998
01:03:12,417 --> 01:03:14,032
I never have any dreams

999
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,198
And I don't know what is the dream

1000
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:18,744
I only know what is failure

1001
01:03:20,042 --> 01:03:21,703
I'm not good at other things

1002
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,949
Except failure

1003
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:27,575
Chinese students are the most prone to failure students in the world

1004
01:03:27,708 --> 01:03:30,780
Because you have to face the most brutal test in the world

1005
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,203
The Ministry of Education announced the enrollment rate in 1993

1006
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:37,200
From middle school to high school is 44.1%

1007
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,994
That means nearly 6 millions students have failed.

1008
01:03:39,125 --> 01:03:41,832
The college entrance examination's enrollment rate is 39.9%

1009
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,118
1 million and 40 thousands students have failed

1010
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:46,287
The students who came to NEW DREAM
to take the TOEFL and GRE exams
 
1011
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:47,076
I already calculated the proportion

1012
01:03:47,208 --> 01:03:50,826
About 1/4 students can made it to study abroad and get the U.S scholarship 

1013
01:03:50,958 --> 01:03:52,494
Another 30 thousands students have failed

1014
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:54,414
Failure is everywhere

1015
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:56,123
Life is so desperate

1016
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,911
This is the reality

1017
01:03:59,917 --> 01:04:01,032
So what should we do?

1018
01:04:02,292 --> 01:04:03,998
Fall into the water you won't drown

1019
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,953
Stay into the water you will drown

1020
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:08,323
You have to swim

1021
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,618
And keep moving forward

1022
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,787
Those people who choose to give up from the beginning
They won't suffer failure

1023
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:14,782
because they have failed from the beginning

1024
01:04:15,375 --> 01:04:16,831
Failure is not terrible thing

1025
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:20,280
Fear of failure is the really terrible thing

1026
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:24,825
We need to find the victory out of the defeat

1027
01:04:24,958 --> 01:04:26,539
Find hope

1028
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,740
in despair

1029
01:04:53,708 --> 01:04:54,914
Who is responsible in here?

1030
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:58,535
Me

1031
01:04:59,542 --> 01:05:03,740
You are using abandoned factory as campus unauthorized,
without permission from goverment agencies

1032
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:05,957
This is a very serious violation behavior

1033
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:07,038
Besides

1034
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:08,407
You lack of formalities for this campus

1035
01:05:08,542 --> 01:05:09,782
Accordance with the law, you will be banned

1036
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:11,782
Is there something so wrong with that?

1037
01:05:13,167 --> 01:05:14,998
We have submitted the complete formalities

1038
01:05:15,125 --> 01:05:17,286
We can't do anything about they keep delaying the time

1039
01:05:17,417 --> 01:05:19,157
The condition to apply the school certificate

1040
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:22,079
That the applicat must have the academic title of associate professor at least

1041
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,994
Also must be approved by your original units

1042
01:05:24,125 --> 01:05:25,456
You have both unqualified

1043
01:05:25,583 --> 01:05:29,371
Listen, We are negotiating with the departments concerned

1044
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:30,956
They have agreed to help us out.

1045
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:33,074
We're just in accordance with legal procedures

1046
01:05:33,208 --> 01:05:33,947
Can't help 

1047
01:05:34,083 --> 01:05:36,290
What makes you say to banned our school?

1048
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:38,453
Now the country support the private schools 

1049
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,448
We are protected by law

1050
01:05:40,583 --> 01:05:41,789
Who are you

1051
01:05:41,917 --> 01:05:43,327
Let me talk

1052
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:44,618
It's not like we do nothing

1053
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:46,206
It's because they keep delaying the time

1054
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,618
Also we are protected by law

1055
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:48,660
If you breach of privilege

1056
01:05:48,792 --> 01:05:49,451
I will sue you

1057
01:05:49,583 --> 01:05:50,288
Then go!

1058
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:51,907
I'm waiting,go!

1059
01:05:52,042 --> 01:05:52,997
You can't do that, sorry

1060
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,865
Our friend got drunk

1061
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,207
He just back from U.S

1062
01:05:57,333 --> 01:05:58,322
Still jetlaging

1063
01:05:58,458 --> 01:06:00,164
Is that makes you so different

1064
01:06:00,292 --> 01:06:01,532
If you got the guts why you're back 

1065
01:06:01,667 --> 01:06:02,907
No,no,You say that again

1066
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,998
Sit

1067
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,536
Pleast,tell us how much?

1068
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:08,406
We will take the punishment

1069
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,864
Xiao jun

1070
01:06:12,542 --> 01:06:14,282
This is not U.S,it's China

1071
01:06:14,833 --> 01:06:17,575
Sue the cops doesn't work here

1072
01:06:18,458 --> 01:06:20,790
I didn't think you were so naive

1073
01:06:23,833 --> 01:06:24,663
Get in

1074
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:25,781
I'm not going back to U.S

1075
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:26,989
Cheng Dongqing

1076
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,160
I will stay

1077
01:06:31,125 --> 01:06:32,285
Be your partner

1078
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:47,115
If the NEW DREAM also be a VCR

1079
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,161


1080
01:06:49,292 --> 01:06:51,658
Meng Xiaojun has the remote

1081
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:52,827
Ambition

1082
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,413
(In chinese:I must win)

1083
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:58,285
For him,the remote only has one funciton

1084
01:06:58,917 --> 01:06:59,906
Fast forward button

1085
01:07:00,833 --> 01:07:01,492
Pest

1086
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:02,660
(In chinese:beat it to death)

1087
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,957
The value of the marketing isn't newness

1088
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:08,452
It's share

1089
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:13,291
He launched 25 development project within a year

1090
01:07:13,417 --> 01:07:14,247
It's 30 project

1091
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,161
This is the preparatory plan of the future internet education

1092
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,657
Ponderous

1093
01:07:18,792 --> 01:07:20,157
One plan is

1094
01:07:20,917 --> 01:07:22,077
(in chinese:Fat to death)

1095
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,120
Meng xiaojun said: Teachers are the centre of the traditional university

1096
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:27,365
But the centre of NEW DREAM are students

1097
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:32,748
Let our students give teacher's score

1098
01:07:33,292 --> 01:07:34,828
Students can fire the teacher

1099
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:37,782
You still can be the teacher

1100
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:40,454
If you can't take the simple job as a teacher

1101
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:41,538
There only one way out

1102
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:43,532
This job even suit for idiot

1103
01:07:43,958 --> 01:07:44,993
Like Principal

1104
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,115
This is a bit too much

1105
01:07:48,958 --> 01:07:50,789
Nope,we can go futher than that

1106
01:07:50,917 --> 01:07:52,077
Wang Yang and I believe

1107
01:07:52,583 --> 01:07:54,323
Meng Xiaojun who from U.S

1108
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,948
Has longer-term outlook than us

1109
01:07:56,083 --> 01:07:56,822
The internet

1110
01:07:58,625 --> 01:07:59,740
It seems far away from us

1111
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:02,116
If it close to us means also close to other people

1112
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:06,290
So I always say one word to him:

1113
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:07,247
Yes

1114
01:08:12,167 --> 01:08:14,658
As the president of your campus I've seen,you are the coolest

1115
01:08:14,792 --> 01:08:16,202
This is the largest private school in China

1116
01:08:16,333 --> 01:08:18,870
I would like to ask what's your formula for success

1117
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:21,619
Is there any?at least I don't know

1118
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:23,748
My personal experience is 

1119
01:08:23,875 --> 01:08:25,786
When you realize the failure is a detour

1120
01:08:25,917 --> 01:08:27,908
You've been walking on the track to success  

1121
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:31,115
Principal  here

1122
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,331
ready, shoot

1123
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:34,243
Hold

1124
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:35,656
Let's shoot more

1125
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:36,326
Alright

1126
01:08:37,708 --> 01:08:39,039
Godfather of students

1127
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,407
Cheng Dongqing

1128
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,410
wow,On newspaper now

1129
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:46,539
Do I look like him

1130
01:08:47,458 --> 01:08:50,040
Master Cheng,shareholding reform plans

1131
01:08:50,458 --> 01:08:51,573
Cheng Dongqing

1132
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:53,289
Yes  or  No

1133
01:08:53,625 --> 01:08:56,412
This time I will say:  NO

1134
01:08:57,792 --> 01:08:58,656
Yes

1135
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:01,907
I know this is very important

1136
01:09:02,625 --> 01:09:04,206
Please consider again

1137
01:09:05,417 --> 01:09:07,453
I thought you would say"No"

1138
01:09:12,167 --> 01:09:15,125
Zhang Ji sure gives the lowest score

1139
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:16,913
But

1140
01:09:17,292 --> 01:09:19,032
He was born with no sense of humor

1141
01:09:19,417 --> 01:09:20,406
Just like me

1142
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:23,864
No,  It's alright if he didn't accept the training

1143
01:09:24,417 --> 01:09:26,157
But he even openly opposed our teaching method

1144
01:09:26,292 --> 01:09:27,998
After all he still one of the senior statesmen

1145
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:31,241
Has been with us since the abandoned factory

1146
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,824
Otherwise I can transer him to the school office

1147
01:09:33,958 --> 01:09:35,414
So that means

1148
01:09:35,917 --> 01:09:38,249
He's not fired but just got promotion

1149
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:42,329
I don't understand how come you don't even have the  guts to fire a person

1150
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:44,039
How can you be our leadership

1151
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:50,414
I will change,eventually

1152
01:09:54,125 --> 01:09:55,205
Li Ping

1153
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:56,698
Is there more food

1154
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:58,822
Yep

1155
01:09:58,958 --> 01:09:59,913
Let's talk about the shareholding system reform

1156
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:00,997
What do you think

1157
01:10:02,083 --> 01:10:06,406
Xiaojun,
I think we need to temporarily postpone this

1158
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:07,572
it can't be postpone

1159
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:10,666
You keep it being postponed 
I don't know what do you want

1160
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:12,373
Yes or No?  Just tell me you don't want to decentralization

1161
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,866
No,I never think so

1162
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:21,531
Yes

1163
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:23,368
I agree

1164
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,866
You're the greatest contribution and this is your share

1165
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,786
I take 51%

1166
01:10:35,333 --> 01:10:38,040
You and Wang Yang together 49%

1167
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:40,197
You 25%

1168
01:10:40,583 --> 01:10:41,743
Him 24%

1169
01:10:45,958 --> 01:10:47,823
You cooked this?

1170
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:49,872
Nice

1171
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:57,700
Let's find another time to sign subscription agreement

1172
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,368
Cheng Dongqing

1173
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:09,115
Do you have a dream

1174
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,615
Please,not again

1175
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,331
I feel like vomit to talk about this everyday

1176
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:15,164
Do you have a dream

1177
01:11:15,292 --> 01:11:16,907
You mean spring dream?

1178
01:11:21,375 --> 01:11:22,956
You know,  When you listen to a person

1179
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:26,578
Don't listen to what he says

1180
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,831
But listen to what he doesn't say

1181
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:34,660
What you don't say

1182
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,038
Come on

1183
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,410
You slept with a girl student

1184
01:11:40,458 --> 01:11:41,868
and make her pregnant

1185
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:43,868
Meng Xiaojun

1186
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,035
You can't do this

1187
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:47,582
After all,I'm still a good friend with Liang Qin

1188
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:57,123
You're cheating her

1189
01:11:57,542 --> 01:11:59,032
Shut up

1190
01:12:00,542 --> 01:12:04,615
Our own material part:The TOEFL and GRE test

1191
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:08,371
haven't authorized by EES from USA education service center

1192
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:10,907
it will be a great hidden danger in our future

1193
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:23,873


1194
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:25,573


1195
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,289
 

1196
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,327


1197
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,956


1198
01:12:38,417 --> 01:12:39,372


1199
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:42,333


1200
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,994


1201
01:12:44,333 --> 01:12:45,664


1202
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:48,490


1203
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:50,998


1204
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:58,660
Cheng Dongqing

1205
01:12:58,792 --> 01:12:59,781
The negotiations failed

1206
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:20,830
Please be on the market

1207
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,118
Yeah,be on the market

1208
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:23,911
You really no need take too much pressure

1209
01:13:24,042 --> 01:13:25,498
I don't blame you about the outcome of the negotiations with EES

1210
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:28,368
Still remember druing the 2nd day after I returned home

1211
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:31,412
I said: This isn't just a school

1212
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,365
I didn't say because I didn't want to shock you

1213
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:36,239
You tell me 

1214
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:38,202
Why should we list to the stock market

1215
01:13:39,667 --> 01:13:40,656
To become number one

1216
01:13:40,792 --> 01:13:42,282
I thought we are already number one

1217
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:43,873
certainly not if out of China

1218
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,207
So we need to start listing as soon as possible,the sooner the better

1219
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,457
This time I will say:

1220
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:53,702
NO

1221
01:13:59,042 --> 01:13:59,997
NO

1222
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:10,540
A friend sent me a bottle of 82 Lafite today

1223
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:26,203
We are not lacking of money,why we have to be listed

1224
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,619
I only know reading and only want to do the education

1225
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:30,115
The NEW DREAM belongs to us

1226
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:31,831
Barony cost is the lowest

1227
01:14:31,958 --> 01:14:33,448
The market is investment shareholders

1228
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:35,323
Why give yourself a cage

1229
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,823
everyone is in the cage

1230
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,745
That backward thinking has became his imprison cage

1231
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:40,990
To make the NEW DREAM become internationalization

1232
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:42,240
it has to be listed

1233
01:14:42,375 --> 01:14:43,785
He is not totally oppose

1234
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:45,282
He is just against to listed company right now

1235
01:14:45,417 --> 01:14:48,614
Every competitor wants to become the frist chinese education industry shares

1236
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,739
He felt there is still time

1237
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:50,580
Let me tell you

1238
01:14:50,708 --> 01:14:52,994
No one will remember the second man on the moon

1239
01:14:53,125 --> 01:14:54,615
Why should we leave the earth

1240
01:14:54,917 --> 01:14:55,997
He is too eager

1241
01:14:56,792 --> 01:14:58,407
Education for stability and capital for fast

1242
01:14:58,542 --> 01:14:59,657
They are not compatible

1243
01:14:59,792 --> 01:15:01,407
There not only 3 person on this boat now

1244
01:15:01,542 --> 01:15:02,782
We've got 50 thousands students here

1245
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:04,327
Frist we need ensure the boat won't sink

1246
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:06,119
He dared not risk because of his fear of failure

1247
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:07,535
Afraid of getting back to the loser

1248
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:08,497
There is only one reason

1249
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:09,034
What?

1250
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,249
Because he doesn't deserve today's success

1251
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:16,288
He really said so

1252
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:17,822
Yes

1253
01:15:18,417 --> 01:15:20,157
He said that you are now more and more successful

1254
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:22,032
He's very proud of you

1255
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:28,322
Have you ever thought about what Meng Xiaojun really wants to

1256
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:50,952
Merry Christmas

1257
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:53,453

1258
01:16:02,542 --> 01:16:03,497
What's this

1259
01:16:03,625 --> 01:16:04,740
What's this

1260
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,455
This isn't funny

1261
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:08,364
Cheng Dongqing

1262
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,865
Enjoy your christmas!

1263
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:12,994
This is his christmas gift

1264
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,037
The 300 square meters land that has the right to use for 70 years

1265
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:18,206
He doesn't know

1266
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:19,413
What I really want

1267
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,907
He doesn't know what Meng Xiaojun wants

1268
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:24,448
He can only be sure

1269
01:16:25,167 --> 01:16:26,748
What he doesn't want 

1270
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:42,038
Today is our NEW DREAM's
first time shareholders' meeting

1271
01:16:42,792 --> 01:16:45,374
Please read this business plan

1272
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:48,197
What's this?

1273
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:50,706
Our 3 person's stength is limited

1274
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:52,789
We should reunite all forces we got

1275
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:56,291
Now NEW DREAM belong to everyone who sits here

1276
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,157
My question is why I got less share

1277
01:16:58,292 --> 01:16:59,247
Me too

1278
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,198
I raised 30% of the shares

1279
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,745
Some was given to these old employees

1280
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,457
Others as part of our option pool

1281
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:08,993
All of our shares have been diluted

1282
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,743
But you and Wang Yang are still the largest shareholders except me

1283
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,368
You know it

1284
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:16,910
I just heard

1285
01:17:17,708 --> 01:17:18,743
But I agree

1286
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,116
It seems that I was the last one know about this

1287
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:23,080
Why

1288
01:17:23,208 --> 01:17:24,539
This is my decision after careful consideration

1289
01:17:24,667 --> 01:17:27,283
You're doing this to prevent me continue my listing plan

1290
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:31,906
I was right

1291
01:17:34,292 --> 01:17:35,498
You're too eager

1292
01:17:35,625 --> 01:17:36,705
I just want to slow it down

1293
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:40,617
Some things only have to stopped to see more clearly

1294
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:43,116
Yeah,it has stopped now

1295
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:43,955
You gathered all people here

1296
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:45,664
with the interests

1297
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:49,205
You can deny any plans of mine in the future

1298
01:17:49,583 --> 01:17:50,993
You start taking over my job now,right?

1299
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:51,989
I agree

1300
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,162
Now this is system

1301
01:17:58,167 --> 01:17:59,282
《History as a Mirror》

1302
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,365
a fundamental solution,right?

1303
01:18:02,542 --> 01:18:04,407
Absolute Wanli of the Ming Dynasty

1304
01:18:04,542 --> 01:18:06,908
But Cheng Dongqing, Don't forget what kind of age we are living in now

1305
01:18:07,042 --> 01:18:08,327
I think you may have misunderstood

1306
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,539
That's it! Meeting dissmissed

1307
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:12,453
You've got plan to learn swim with coach, you can go now

1308
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,369
He has already learned

1309
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:15,410
how to swim

1310
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,953
I'm so surprise to see the way you are

1311
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:19,948
Why can't we just talk about this in private

1312
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:21,869
Not only 3 of us on this ship now

1313
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,412
Let me tell you,  Your ship has been out and it can't stop

1314
01:18:24,542 --> 01:18:25,201
Only have to keep moving foward

1315
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:28,040
Nobody can stop the NEW DREAM listed on market

1316
01:18:29,208 --> 01:18:31,449
I have the most significant responsibility for the NEW DREAM

1317
01:18:32,583 --> 01:18:34,073
The person who should make the decision here

1318
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:35,785
It's me

1319
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:39,700
Because I'm the greatest leader in NEW DREAM

1320
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:40,784
Leader

1321
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:43,032
I was the one who give the "NEW DREAM" advise

1322
01:18:43,167 --> 01:18:44,202
The technology layer is given by Wang Yang

1323
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:45,072
As for you

1324
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,707
Except take money with sacks,What else do you know?

1325
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,119
Cheng Dongqing,Lackeys of the US

1326
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:02,824
NEW DREAM the lackey's school

1327
01:19:02,958 --> 01:19:06,496
Traitor Cheng Dongqing,you're a traitor

1328
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:07,865
Who is the traitor

1329
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,240
Call the police,quick

1330
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,912
Who is the national sinners, Who is the traitor

1331
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:23,331
Americans bombed Chinese embassy

1332
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:25,540
You came to hit the english school

1333
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:27,658
What if aliens blow the earth

1334
01:19:28,667 --> 01:19:30,123
Are you going to hit the space department?

1335
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:33,083
He can always step in at the most inopportune times

1336
01:19:34,333 --> 01:19:35,618
This I can't do

1337
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:37,866
What's the difference between 30 years ago and now

1338
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,661
All you do is nest cross

1339
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,789
Chinese people hit chinese people

1340
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:42,952
Coward

1341
01:19:43,208 --> 01:19:44,243
Outrageous

1342
01:19:45,125 --> 01:19:47,207
Go to learn from the person who hit you

1343
01:19:47,333 --> 01:19:49,665
Until you become stronger than him

1344
01:19:52,542 --> 01:19:54,373
Now he is the godfather of students

1345
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,123
Everyone thinks I'm gonna leave

1346
01:20:05,458 --> 01:20:07,995
the number of NEW DREAMS students have broke

1347
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:13,957
Three million eight hundred and eighty-eight thousand eight hundred and eighty-eight

1348
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:30,989
You know when I was fired from the school

1349
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,456
I just started this private school

1350
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:36,155
Everyday I carried the paste barrel ran into the roads and climbed wire pole paste ads

1351
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:39,489
Now whenever I saw the wire pole,I can't help to climb up and paste more ads

1352
01:20:39,625 --> 01:20:40,910
This doesn't hurt

1353
01:20:41,042 --> 01:20:42,157
Do business

1354
01:20:42,292 --> 01:20:44,704
Bowing down is the basic skills

1355
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:48,780
chick's attitude、widow's treatment、women's pursuit

1356
01:20:52,792 --> 01:20:53,872
What does he do recently

1357
01:20:55,542 --> 01:20:57,078
Reading various business management books

1358
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,915
Also researching other company's listed plan book

1359
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,582
This is the market survey report I've done

1360
01:21:07,292 --> 01:21:08,657
Adopted the views of all parties

1361
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:10,453
I think it's not suitable for listing

1362
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:11,789
We need to wait for an opportunity

1363
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:12,747
What opportunities?

1364
01:21:12,875 --> 01:21:13,534
I'm still waiting

1365
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:14,907
Waiting for a Feng Shui master

1366
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,248
We've been waiting for 4 years

1367
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:17,490
During 4 years

1368
01:21:17,625 --> 01:21:19,161
If a new company

1369
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:19,951
can listed also

1370
01:21:20,083 --> 01:21:22,039
What we do is the education industry

1371
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:23,657
It can't be blindly listed

1372
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,990
Besides,America market isn't good during recent 2 years

1373
01:21:26,125 --> 01:21:27,661
The U.S listed Chinese companies

1374
01:21:27,792 --> 01:21:28,497
Either suspended

1375
01:21:28,625 --> 01:21:29,614
Or broke

1376
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:31,448
Most became rubbish shares

1377
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,868
Junk stocks still is stock

1378
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:37,079
Still have more value than just put billions money in the bank  

1379
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,493
Let's ask our shareholders

1380
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:41,116
Can we start listing now

1381
01:21:42,375 --> 01:21:45,788
I propose indefinitely postphone the NEW DREAMS's listing plan

1382
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:47,698
Who agree with me please raise their hands

1383
01:21:57,250 --> 01:21:59,832
Cheng Dongqing, this is the public opinion

1384
01:22:03,833 --> 01:22:05,619
Today I am going to dictatorship for once

1385
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:08,248
I'm the largest shareholder of the company

1386
01:22:08,792 --> 01:22:10,282
have the power of veto

1387
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:12,664
I oppose the listing 

1388
01:22:13,833 --> 01:22:14,822
You're a hillbilly

1389
01:22:16,042 --> 01:22:18,624
Master Cheng,as an senior consultant 
I have the responsibility to remind you

1390
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:22,038
The chinese money will appreciate in the future
It will impact on the domestic industry

1391
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:23,327
But for international business...

1392
01:22:23,458 --> 01:22:24,573
You are...?

1393
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,285
Xu Wen,I was your student

1394
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:28,874
Now as the NEW DREAM's listed investment adviser

1395
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,160
You're fired

1396
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:31,618
I'm listening to you

1397
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,411
Learning how to fire people

1398
01:22:34,875 --> 01:22:36,661
Cheng Dongqing,fuck you!Cheng Dongqing

1399
01:22:36,792 --> 01:22:37,781
Mr Meng,  Master Meng

1400
01:22:37,917 --> 01:22:39,578
Cheng Dongqing,  fuck you

1401
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:40,955
What do you want?

1402
01:22:41,083 --> 01:22:42,198
You fooled everyone

1403
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:45,120
For so many years,don't you feel shame!

1404
01:22:54,917 --> 01:22:56,202
Are you finished?

1405
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,823
Then I have something to say

1406
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:04,789
I'm getting married

1407
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,245
Wait...Who are you getting married to?

1408
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:50,620
Thank you so much for join my wedding

1409
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,039
getting married is the coolest and the most sense of achievement thing

1410
01:23:53,167 --> 01:23:54,452
in my life

1411
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,912
Also very grateful to my wife Li Ping

1412
01:23:58,042 --> 01:23:58,872
willing to marry me

1413
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,206
She let me know

1414
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:03,450
True love comes quietly without any toss

1415
01:24:03,917 --> 01:24:04,906
and I will love you forever

1416
01:24:19,083 --> 01:24:22,450
Finally,give you 3 pieces of advice

1417
01:24:23,875 --> 01:24:25,581
Never play mahjong with mother in law

1418
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:31,200
Never sleep with the woman who has more ideas 

1419
01:24:35,625 --> 01:24:38,662
Don't set up a company with your best friends

1420
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,704
I hope everyone today can eat good and drink good,enjoy!

1421
01:24:51,833 --> 01:24:53,198
Toast

1422
01:24:53,333 --> 01:24:54,539
Bottoms up

1423
01:24:55,958 --> 01:24:57,323
Cheers

1424
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:05,952
Cheers

1425
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:22,082
I've only had one life

1426
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:24,411
Not the same with others

1427
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:26,410
Now I know

1428
01:25:26,875 --> 01:25:28,991
The way of life that most people pick

1429
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:30,240
will be worthwhile

1430
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,619
So I married Li Ping

1431
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:35,913
I'm so happy,very happy today

1432
01:25:40,958 --> 01:25:41,993
I want to withdraw share

1433
01:25:43,667 --> 01:25:44,577
What?

1434
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:46,989
What did you say?

1435
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,413
I'm done

1436
01:25:51,208 --> 01:25:52,197
Meng Xiaojun

1437
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:54,039
the NEW DREAM can't without you

1438
01:25:55,042 --> 01:25:55,906
I decided

1439
01:25:56,917 --> 01:25:58,873
We've been friends for more than 20 years, man

1440
01:25:59,000 --> 01:25:59,989
Friends?

1441
01:26:00,417 --> 01:26:01,406
You want to talk about feelings

1442
01:26:05,167 --> 01:26:07,909
When we were in school

1443
01:26:08,042 --> 01:26:09,031
I believed once

1444
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:10,784
I went to America

1445
01:26:10,917 --> 01:26:13,158
You guys went to see me off at the airport I beleived once

1446
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:17,664
Now? I don't believe

1447
01:26:24,375 --> 01:26:25,865
Let's talk openly

1448
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:29,535
Remember that dictionary?

1449
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,082
Those words I wrote on that note

1450
01:26:32,208 --> 01:26:33,118
that wasn't for you

1451
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:34,913
It's for myself

1452
01:26:36,375 --> 01:26:37,911
Sorry to let you misunderstood

1453
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:50,948
I know,in your mind

1454
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,869
I've always been a 

1455
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,911
Stupid hillbilly

1456
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:57,532
Meng Xiaojun,You carried it too far today

1457
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:02,364
If not Cheng Dongqing,I wouldn't be friends with you at all

1458
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:06,075
You always think your own business is more important than others

1459
01:27:06,750 --> 01:27:07,990
Do you remember that time

1460
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:12,120
He had tuberculosis,and you said you have to take the TOEFL

1461
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,956
You didn't want to see him

1462
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:16,622
You're so selfish

1463
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:19,578
So it's because of this

1464
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,035
Since that day

1465
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:23,990
You think I despise you

1466
01:27:24,125 --> 01:27:26,036
So you have been looking for a chance

1467
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:27,828
to stop me doing one thing

1468
01:27:27,958 --> 01:27:29,289
then give me a lesson

1469
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:30,247
Right?

1470
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:32,494
Isn't that interesting,Cheng Dongqing?

1471
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:33,955
Yep

1472
01:27:34,083 --> 01:27:35,243
I think it's interesting

1473
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:36,581
Very interesting

1474
01:27:36,708 --> 01:27:37,868
If you want to quit

1475
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,491
I will use 1 million yuan buy your each share,in cash!

1476
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,990
What's your problem?

1477
01:27:44,417 --> 01:27:45,657
What are you talking about?

1478
01:27:46,250 --> 01:27:48,036
You called him back from US at the beginning

1479
01:27:48,167 --> 01:27:49,407
He has been worked so hard for company

1480
01:27:49,542 --> 01:27:52,454
and now you're treating him like this,are we still friends?

1481
01:27:52,583 --> 01:27:54,414
Am I not?

1482
01:27:55,375 --> 01:27:58,492
Do you think I doing this for myself?

1483
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,698
Yeah,I'm doing this for myself

1484
01:28:01,833 --> 01:28:03,323
At least I admit

1485
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:04,368
Cut it out, stop

1486
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:06,832
Maybe you should make a fight like man

1487
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:07,822
Come on,come on

1488
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,744
Make a fight!come on

1489
01:28:10,417 --> 01:28:12,157
You metioned quit first

1490
01:28:12,542 --> 01:28:15,249
Something wrong with you since you back from US,why?

1491
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:16,785
At least I fought for once

1492
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:20,865
And you?got crushed by a US girl

1493
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:22,748
What did you say?

1494
01:28:27,125 --> 01:28:28,240
Stop!

1495
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:33,495
Get away,stop!

1496
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:40,697
Well

1497
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:42,122
Yes

1498
01:28:42,958 --> 01:28:44,073
I'm crazy

1499
01:28:44,417 --> 01:28:45,122
You

1500
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:46,535
Godfather of students

1501
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:47,873
Elite returnees

1502
01:28:48,417 --> 01:28:49,452
You all kickass

1503
01:28:50,417 --> 01:28:53,159
Look what we become now

1504
01:28:53,292 --> 01:28:55,533
What we become now

1505
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:02,249
I've never been a overseas elite

1506
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,706
Do you have any idea what did I do in US

1507
01:29:03,833 --> 01:29:04,743
How should I know

1508
01:29:04,875 --> 01:29:06,365
I wasn't even a waiter

1509
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:07,205
I was a handyman

1510
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,198
Even not eligible for tips

1511
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,243
Do you understand?

1512
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,744
I couldn't live any longer, so I'm back

1513
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:15,490
I have no friends

1514
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:18,953
except you two

1515
01:29:20,417 --> 01:29:21,907
I don't care if you are happy or not

1516
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:22,906
I've told you everything

1517
01:29:23,042 --> 01:29:23,997
What about you?

1518
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:24,830
Stage fright

1519
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,118
I do have this phobia

1520
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,239
I dare not say

1521
01:29:27,375 --> 01:29:29,161
Why don't you ever metion?

1522
01:29:29,292 --> 01:29:31,408
Have you ever disscussed about this with me,are we friends?

1523
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,614
Friends

1524
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:50,289
Wang Yang,you are wrong

1525
01:29:53,542 --> 01:29:56,284
I used to thought my own business is more important than others

1526
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:01,410
Used to 

1527
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:06,077
I will go to Shen Yang tommorow

1528
01:30:07,500 --> 01:30:09,536
There is a person want to open a private english school

1529
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,331
So many years

1530
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:32,118
I've been tired everyday

1531
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:37,159
I did all this for you two

1532
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,785

1533

Don't want to play no more

1534
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:30,329
I've been numerously wanted to meet her again 

1535
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,665

1536
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:36,408
I'm proud of you today

1537
01:32:38,708 --> 01:32:41,495


1538
01:32:52,375 --> 01:32:53,490
Cheng Dongqing

1539
01:32:56,542 --> 01:32:58,783
If we changed the world 

1540
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,286
or the world changed us

1541
01:33:31,167 --> 01:33:32,873
president Cheng is coming

1542
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,912
President Cheng,president Cheng

1543
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:39,739
President Cheng, if the success of the NEW DREAM because of the piracy

1544
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,581
President Cheng, rumor says the NEW DREAM because face prosecution

1545
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:42,538

1546
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:45,124
If the USA has formally request sealed up the NEW DREAM?

1547
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:19,789
You haven't been to US,right?

1548
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,867


1549
01:34:52,417 --> 01:34:53,907
At least tell me the way

1550
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,035


1551
01:34:59,167 --> 01:35:01,374


1552
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:04,663


1553
01:35:04,792 --> 01:35:07,329


1554
01:35:07,458 --> 01:35:09,414


1555
01:35:09,792 --> 01:35:11,248


1556
01:35:12,042 --> 01:35:15,614


1557
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:17,536


1558
01:35:17,667 --> 01:35:19,248


1559
01:35:19,375 --> 01:35:23,163


1560
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:27,706


1561
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:29,369


1562
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,663


1563
01:35:32,792 --> 01:35:34,578


1564
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:36,448


1565
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:37,368


1566
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,741


1567
01:35:40,708 --> 01:35:42,448


1568
01:35:44,083 --> 01:35:44,993


1569
01:35:47,042 --> 01:35:48,532
Let's look for a chinese restaurant

1570
01:35:48,667 --> 01:35:50,953
Great! I miss chinese food

1571
01:35:51,542 --> 01:35:52,452
Come on

1572
01:35:57,833 --> 01:35:58,822
Where are we going?

1573
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:01,370
Let me take you go a place,western-style food

1574
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,948
This is the place where I used to work

1575
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:07,704


1576
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:08,618


1577
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:09,830
Yeah,she is the woman

1578
01:36:09,958 --> 01:36:10,947
sometimes

1579
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:14,287
She gave me some small change

1580
01:36:14,417 --> 01:36:16,578
I earn the least 

1581
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:17,493


1582
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:19,156


1583
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:20,122


1584
01:36:21,083 --> 01:36:22,744
When I frist time came to America

1585
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:26,242
fed the mice in the lab

1586
01:36:26,875 --> 01:36:27,990
and carried dishes in here

1587
01:36:29,125 --> 01:36:30,331
When I second time came here

1588
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,619
I took our busniess came here

1589
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,331
the busniess I'm proud of

1590
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:40,413
I want to tell them that I'm not a loser

1591
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:43,368
But they even...

1592
01:36:45,792 --> 01:36:48,329
They even didn't give you the most basic respect

1593
01:36:52,292 --> 01:36:53,702


1594
01:36:55,833 --> 01:36:57,869
They kept checking me up over and over again for a hour

1595
01:36:59,292 --> 01:37:01,999
They still think the people who come to American all want to illegal immigrant

1596
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,615


1597
01:37:03,750 --> 01:37:04,830


1598
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:06,243


1599
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:09,367


1600
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:11,493


1601
01:37:14,917 --> 01:37:16,828


1602
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,368


1603
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,239


1604
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,199
I waited for 6 hours,and drank 8 cups coffee

1605
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,740


1606
01:37:24,875 --> 01:37:27,412


1607
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:28,201


1608
01:37:28,333 --> 01:37:31,405


1609
01:37:31,542 --> 01:37:32,907


1610
01:37:33,042 --> 01:37:34,907
At that moment I realized

1611
01:37:35,042 --> 01:37:39,160
We are really too young too naive

1612
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,618
So I think

1613
01:37:49,417 --> 01:37:50,623
Only if

1614
01:37:51,083 --> 01:37:53,745
at the moment when we standing on the NYSE and swinging the hammer 

1615
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:56,287
They will really see you

1616
01:37:56,917 --> 01:37:57,906
Recognize you

1617
01:37:58,667 --> 01:37:59,577
Respect you

1618
01:38:04,917 --> 01:38:05,827
Cheng Dongqing

1619
01:38:06,625 --> 01:38:07,489
You're rigtht

1620
01:38:08,208 --> 01:38:09,744
We don't need listed 

1621
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:12,198
I admit I did that for myself

1622
01:38:14,125 --> 01:38:14,830
I'm sorry

1623
01:38:25,042 --> 01:38:26,122
Xiao Jun

1624
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:27,743
After eat

1625
01:38:29,167 --> 01:38:30,623
Let's capture America

1626
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:45,993

1712
01:43:09,792 --> 01:43:12,625


1713
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:15,248


1714
01:43:15,667 --> 01:43:18,329


1715
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:20,535


1716
01:43:21,958 --> 01:43:23,198


1717
01:43:23,750 --> 01:43:26,457


1718
01:43:27,042 --> 01:43:28,953


1719
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:31,745


1720
01:43:32,542 --> 01:43:34,078


1721
01:43:34,667 --> 01:43:38,410


1722
01:43:58,625 --> 01:44:00,456


1723
01:44:28,542 --> 01:44:29,748


1724
01:44:31,625 --> 01:44:33,661


1725
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,531


1726
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:40,822
Xiao Jun

1727
01:44:42,625 --> 01:44:45,082
The laboratory now with your name

1728
01:44:46,333 --> 01:44:48,164
I did the donation with your name

1729
01:45:01,042 --> 01:45:05,365
The gift I gave to you last time,actually I don't like it either

1730
01:45:06,208 --> 01:45:08,745
Don't know how do you like this one?

1731
01:45:24,833 --> 01:45:25,822
Hillbilly

1732
01:45:27,083 --> 01:45:28,744
I like this one

1733
01:45:54,583 --> 01:45:57,290
Second day,  we went to Vegas

1734
01:45:57,417 --> 01:45:59,533
Cheng Dongqing lost bets till nose bleeding

1735
01:46:00,417 --> 01:46:03,159
Sometimes I still go back

1736
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:05,657
go back to those bright days

1737
01:46:13,667 --> 01:46:17,034
As the host,Su Mei specially invited us to eat a meal

1738
01:46:17,167 --> 01:46:20,079
She told me,the most important thing is not success

1739
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:23,655
But as a man,you can't lose dignity

1740
01:46:24,917 --> 01:46:27,374
That day I had a dream

1741
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,492
Meng Xiaojun from 1980 walked in the street of New York

1742
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,992
He looks so young,so confident

1743
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,740
Just like the sunshine in the street

1744
01:46:36,583 --> 01:46:40,576
Then I told him,  When wrinkles have carved on the forehead 

1745
01:46:40,708 --> 01:46:42,164
All you can do is

1746
01:46:42,292 --> 01:46:44,999
Don't let wrinkles engraved in your heart

1747
01:46:53,625 --> 01:46:55,866
Cheng Dongqing replaced his sexual life with speech

1748
01:46:56,542 --> 01:46:59,500
Now he doesn't speak like human in public places

1749
01:46:59,833 --> 01:47:00,822
That makes me sick

1750
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,332
He turns of the lights not for romance, but for saving money

1751
01:47:06,958 --> 01:47:09,199
He never want to change the world

1752
01:47:09,833 --> 01:47:10,663
But at least

1753
01:47:11,208 --> 01:47:13,164
He can make himself not changed by the world

1754
01:47:14,458 --> 01:47:17,495
To be a hillbilly boy forever!
